# UI/UX Pro Max

Advanced skill for creating exceptional, user-centered interfaces with focus on usability, aesthetics, and conversion optimization.

## Design Principles

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- **Size**: Larger elements draw attention first
- **Color**: Use accent colors for important actions
- **Spacing**: Group related items, separate distinct sections
- **Typography**: Clear font weights and sizes for hierarchy

### 2. User Flow Optimization
- **Reduce Friction**: Minimize steps to complete actions
- **Clear CTAs**: Buttons that communicate their action
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show information as needed
- **Error Prevention**: Guide users before errors occur

### 3. Micro-Interactions
- **Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens, progress indicators
- **Hover Effects**: Indicate interactivity
- **Transitions**: Smooth, purposeful animations (200-300ms)

### 4. Mobile-First Design
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px
- **Thumb Zones**: Important actions in easy reach
- **Gestures**: Swipe, pull-to-refresh patterns
- **Responsive**: Fluid layouts, not just breakpoints

## Component Best Practices

### Buttons
- Primary action stands out (color, size)
- Clear, action-oriented labels ("Add to Cart" not "Submit")
- Adequate padding and touch targets
- Disabled state is visually distinct

### Forms
- Labels above inputs (not placeholder-only)
- Inline validation with helpful messages
- Clear error states with recovery guidance
- Progress for multi-step forms

### Cards
- Consistent padding and border-radius
- Clear visual separation
- Hover states indicate interactivity
- Image-to-content ratio balanced

### Navigation
- Current location always visible
- Breadcrumbs for deep hierarchies
- Consistent placement across pages
- Mobile hamburger menu done right

## Conversion Optimization

### E-commerce Specifics
- Product images: Multiple angles, zoom capability
- Price clarity: No hidden fees until checkout
- Trust signals: Reviews, secure badges, guarantees
- Cart persistence: Save cart across sessions

### Call-to-Action
- Single primary action per view
- Contrasting color from page palette
- Above the fold on landing pages
- Urgency without manipulation

## Accessibility Integration
- Color is not the only indicator
- Focus states visible and styled
- Motion respects reduced-motion preference
- Content readable without CSS
