# Supabase Postgres Best Practices

Comprehensive performance optimization guide for Postgres, maintained by Supabase. Contains rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated query optimization and schema design.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing SQL queries or designing schemas
- Implementing indexes or query optimization
- Reviewing database performance issues
- Configuring connection pooling or scaling
- Optimizing for Postgres-specific features
- Working with Row-Level Security (RLS)

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Query Performance | CRITICAL | `query-` |
| 2 | Connection Management | CRITICAL | `conn-` |
| 3 | Security & RLS | CRITICAL | `security-` |
| 4 | Schema Design | HIGH | `schema-` |
| 5 | Concurrency & Locking | MEDIUM-HIGH | `lock-` |
| 6 | Data Access Patterns | MEDIUM | `data-` |
| 7 | Monitoring & Diagnostics | LOW-MEDIUM | `monitor-` |
| 8 | Advanced Features | LOW | `advanced-` |

## Key Optimization Areas

### Query Performance
- Use appropriate indexes for your access patterns
- Avoid SELECT * - specify only needed columns
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query plans
- Batch operations where possible

### Connection Management
- Use connection pooling (pgBouncer)
- Set appropriate pool sizes
- Handle connection limits gracefully

### Security & RLS
- Implement Row-Level Security policies
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Grant minimal required permissions

### Schema Design
- Choose appropriate data types
- Use partial indexes for filtered queries
- Normalize appropriately for your use case
